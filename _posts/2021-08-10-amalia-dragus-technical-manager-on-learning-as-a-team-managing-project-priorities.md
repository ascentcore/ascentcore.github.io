# Amalia Dragus, Technical Manager, on Learning as a Team & Managing Project Priorities

Amalia Dragus is a passionate manager who is always on the lookout for the latest technological updates. Her relationship with AscentCore goes back a long way, and we’re really lucky to have her on our team. In her current role, Amalia promotes a healthy growth mindset within her team members by encouraging them to explore new things outside their comfort zone while still providing steady support when they need it most.

We sat down with her virtually to learn about her journey, and a few valuable insights regarding team management.

## What is your favorite tech?

My favorite tech is one that changes and improves our lives. At one point I had the opportunity to be part of the digitalization of a broadcasting company. I was there when they moved the business online and throughout the expansion on all the existing and emerging mobile and OTT platforms. It was a rich experience - gathering feedback from an entire user base and learning how different generations adapt and use the products.

## What is a typical work day for you?

My day starts with my kid and my cat storming in together to announce that the “sun is up, get up!” and “Meow!”. After dropping my son to kindergarten, I love getting a coffee with my husband, then planning the rest of the day with the team in the morning standup meeting. The rest of the day is spent supporting the team - clearing roadblocks, helping to answer questions, and establishing and managing priorities. The afternoon is when we connect with the US client team, and have sync-ups and various other meetings.

## Why did you choose to work at AscentCore?

Firstly, because I know and have worked with Catalin, one of AscentCore’s Managing Partners, for almost 15 years now. I share his values and ways of working. 

Secondly, because I was offered the challenge to build an entire team from scratch, to start and build a relationship with a new client, and to be involved in an industry that was totally new to me. I’m still learning every day, which is the most important aspect of the job to me.

## What is your favorite AscentCore value and why?

Do I have to name just one? I believe that building a strong relationship within the team, and then with the client, and growing together through collaboration and integrity, is the perfect way to get the best results. But if I had to choose one, I would say the results, because at the end of the day, that’s what we all want. We all want our work to mean something to someone, to be valued, and to change someone’s life.

## What is the most important lesson you’ve learned in your role?

I learned to stop focusing on the gravity of a situation and start focusing on what I can do about it. It saved me a lot of time and headaches.
