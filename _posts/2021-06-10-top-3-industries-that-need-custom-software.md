# Top 3 Industries That Need Custom Software

In a digitally-oriented landscape, businesses can benefit from integrating custom software that functions according to their unique needs. Custom software offers tailor-made solutions that consider your business practices, making it easier to generate value and boost efficiency in almost all daily operations.

So, what are the benefits of custom software? There are many, but a few include a scalable sales channel; optimized business processes; competitive advantage; streamlined operations; and boosts in sales and profits. A custom system, however, often comes at a steep price tag. Some companies may see this innovative technology as a luxury that provides a competitive edge, but there are key industries that see custom software applications as more of a necessity in the long run.

If you’re wondering if you fall into the list of businesses that can maximize the benefits of custom software, keep reading as we explore the industries that need this technology the most.

## 1. Healthcare

Healthcare is an ever-evolving industry that strives to stay on top of the latest technology to better improve their quality of patient care. But the vastness of varying regulations, rules, and region-specific particularities make it tricky to create a one-stop-shop for all medical needs. Additionally, healthcare facilities deal with sensitive patient data, making handling different regional requirements complex and requiring extensive security measures.

With all of the unique and complex requirements for the healthcare industry, implementing an out-of-the-box software solution is likely to leave many gaps and shortcomings that can result in security hacks or breaches, inadequate compliance, and more. For these reasons, it makes sense for healthcare companies to adopt custom software that supports their unique needs.

## 2. Businesses

Every business - from for-profit companies to retail stores - caters to different markets with distinct needs, personalities, and interests. The needs of a technology company will vary greatly from the needs of a restaurant, so bespoke applications can be set-up for how a business needs to operate, their audience’s paint points, and any other unique needs they may have. This can result in better strategies that establish a more meaningful connection to customers and help a business run more efficiently and effectively.

## 3. FinTech

FinTech companies play an integral role in pushing the economy forward, particularly in protecting financial data and providing better payment options to customers. Consumer banking, insurance, billing, lending, and wealth management companies all handle sensitive customer data, requiring stringent security measures to keep this information safe. With increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks resulting in vast amounts of exposed data, custom software applications can offer better cybersecurity risk management, regulatory compliance, and instant fraud detection. This not only keeps customer information safe, it increases the reputation of and reliability of FinTech companies and keeps their customers reassured that their information is in good hands.

## Conclusion

Off-the-shelf software offers a good starting point for several industries, but for businesses ready to scale their operations, boost their security, and enhance their personalization, bespoke software provides solutions that can be impossible to find elsewhere.
