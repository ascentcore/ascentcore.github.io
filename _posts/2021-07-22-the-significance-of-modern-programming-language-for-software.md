# The Significance of Modern Programming Languages for Software

Software is the backbone of all digital technologies in use today. From Internet browsers to programs, software is critical in telling a computer how to work. And while the art and science of building software has been around for many decades, there have been many advancements in how it is created and used. Unfortunately, many of these systems still rely on outdated programming languages which can result in systems and infrastructures that are highly flawed at best, or don’t work at all.

In this article, we’ll dive into the importance of using modern and up-to-date programming language for building software, and what can happen when you don’t.

## The downsides of using old programming language

During the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of people in the US lost their jobs or were forced to collect unemployment to stay afloat. As a result, many state’s unemployment insurance systems were inundated with millions of new applications. New Jersey was one such state and as a result, the governor issued an urgent request for software developers with COBOL programming experience (the language their unemployment system was built with) to ensure the system could handle the volume of applications.

COBOL is a computer language that has been around for almost 60 years. Developers with COBOL experience had been in short supply as far back as the 1980s, since many institutions discontinued teaching it after the 1970s. As a result, systems built with that language are now overburdened with few people available to maintain and fix them, which means they are prone to failure. While it's unusual for a legacy infrastructure to have so many flaws so fast, no one anticipated the pandemic and the strain its effects would put on software systems.

Even before this crisis, there had been numerous calls to replace outdated systems but they were not heeded or implemented in a widespread manner. Because of this, states like New Jersey face extreme obstacles in providing essential state services because they use antiquated software.

## Implementing custom software solutions

The example above is just one of many that illustrates why businesses and agencies must pursue proactive IT measurements, such as implementing custom software solutions that include modern programming languages.

In addition to ensuring that all of your systems are in good operating order, utilizing modern programming language has numerous benefits, including: 
- **A secure network.** Custom software solutions can protect you from cyberattacks, fix weaknesses in advance, and prevent viruses from infiltrating your system. All things which will ensure your systems run efficiently with minimal flaws.
- **Access to customer support.** If you have problems with Adobe or Microsoft Teams, for instance, you can easily contact customer service. A ticket or a phone call can be placed, and if the problem is too complicated for a front-line worker, the issue can be escalated to get the necessary help. But if you’re using an outdated programming language, a solution will be hard to come by. 
- **Prevent critical flaws and breakdowns.** An updated programming language will allow you to catch and resolve issues much quicker and will have fewer flaws by virtue of being newer. 
- **Simplified software and systems.** Current software programs are written in modern computer coding languages which allows for ease of interactions and access to other programs through APIs and modular interfaces.

These are just a few of the benefits of using modern programming languages for your software. Not only can you keep up with the fast-paced environment of the digital world, you’ll make your processes more efficient and reliable.

## Conclusion

In the end, we can boil it down to venturing into long-term investments with massive benefits. A computer's lifespan is determined by how old its hardware and software becomes, so we need to check them periodically to determine if changes are to be made. Just like most things, programming needs regular updates to keep functioning at an optimal level. That's why it’s essential to understand and advocate for relevant languages to maintain software for your business.
