# 4 Advantages of Having Custom Software Built for Your Business

To keep up with the rapid evolution of technology, businesses are increasingly turning to custom software to meet their needs. Custom development may seem daunting because the scope of the project is hard to define, and the outcomes and cost expectation are unclear. But inevitably these made-to-order software solutions have proven to be essential for successful digital transformation and business growth. Here are some important advantages of custom software that you should consider.

## 1. Optimized Business Processes 

Every organization is built around its own business model and in-house processes. It would be quite disadvantageous for that organization to adjust their ways of working just to suit a particular software package or application, no matter how powerful it may be. What these companies don’t realize is that by changing their existing process as a workaround for a packaged software, it costs them more time and money in the long run.

Custom software designed and developed to align to your own business model and unique in-house processes would ultimately be more efficient and cost-effective for your employees and your entire organization. Custom software is built to help optimize your own processes instead of replacing them.

## 2. Scalability

Since personalized software is built for your specific needs, it can easily integrate with your processes and it lets you scale as your business grows. As you expand your business, changes in your process are expected, and your development team can make the necessary adjustments to your software.

Another opportunity with home-grown software is the integration scalable features during the early stages of development. That creates long-term advantages and convenience as your company reaches key growth milestones.

## 3. Reducing Cost

Purchasing boiler-plate software solutions is usually cheaper and more convenient on the front end, but remember that the initial price tag for 3rd party software is a small percentage of total cost of ongoing implementation, customization, maintenance, etc. In most cases, there are recurring licensing and labor costs that aren't baked into initial cost. In short, you may end up shelling out more money for 3rd party solutions than you initially budgeted for.

Custom programming, by comparison, invariably comes with a higher upfront cost to cover the development and design effort, but that investment is “frontloaded.” Where licensing fees are a sunk cost, the recurring costs associated with a custom solution generally add value to the solution and the company. If you need a few maintenance patches here and there, that’s still quite inexpensive compared to buying a new software package annually or bootstrapping an existing 3rd party tool.

## 4. Software Ownership

When you buy off-the-shelf software, you have the privilege (or the right) to use that product for as long as you’re willing to pay for it. In addition to the regular license and usage fees of, you will be bound by the limitations, rules, and regulations of the solution. Also, keep in mind that you may need to pay for a new version of the product or find a replacement if the licensing company stops servicing your version of the software.

When you invest in custom software, you end up with a product that is completely yours, and you have complete control over it. If you’re aiming for a long-term commitment to a digital product that your company will use every day, consider investing in your own custom software.

## Conclusion
