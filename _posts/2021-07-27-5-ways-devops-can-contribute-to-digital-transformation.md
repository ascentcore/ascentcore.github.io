# 5 Ways DevOps Can Contribute to Digital Transformation

Many organizations today have found themselves grappling with digital transformation to improve business processes and stay innovative in a competitive landscape. However, it can be challenging to know where to start and how to make adjustments in areas such as security, vision alignment, culture, and structure, just to name a few.

Keep reading to learn more about DevOps and how it can help businesses successfully implement digital transformation initiatives.

## What is DevOps?

Development and Operations, more popularly known as DevOps, is a set of practices that integrate and automate software development and IT processes. It allows the two teams to work together to build, test, and release software faster and more reliably. DevOps serves as a bridge between the development department and operations team that can often be siloed from each other.

## How does DevOps Contribute to Digital Transformation?

**1. Changing Mindsets**

As mentioned, corporate culture can be one of the main roadblocks to growth and transformation for a business. It can be difficult to do away with traditional processes for development, shipping, operations, and more, to make room for the adoption of new technologies. But DevOps can turn this mindset by helping businesses understand the benefits and implement new ways of operating to improve efficiency and coordination.

**2. Combining People, Processes, and Technology**

DevOps can be the space where people, processes, and technology come together to achieve related business goals. As a result, organizations can deliver new products and services to their clients faster, and more easily meet demanding deadlines. In essence, DevOps brings the three together, enabling them to grow and adapt to new technologies as one.

**3. Improving Practices for the Organization**

DevOps can help businesses increase their performance not only in the digital realm, but across the organization. Implementing the collaborative mindset of DevOps can have ripple effects across an organization, allowing for faster innovation and processes to increase their competitive advantage.  

**4. Encouraging Companies to Steer Toward Better Solutions**

When adapting and utilizing DevOps, companies can be inspired to innovate better solutions to improve specific processes. It can enable them to make positive and active changes to software applications and services affecting the operations team by improving various aspects and sectors to maximize productivity. As a result, DevOps continuously contributes to digital transformation by developing and implementing new systems and IT infrastructure that are helpful for any organization’s products and services.

**5. Allowing for Continuous and Regular Change**

DevOps can help with flexibility in terms of change management, allowing a business to make faster decisions, adapt to change when needed, and be more agile. It can also support rapid experimentation to improve the business’s ability to understand or interpret feedback quickly. In fact, it enables the development of feedback based change and enhances the speed to implement those changes out to the market.

## Conclusion

As your business adapts to rapid-paced technological developments, DevOps can help you keep up and manage the many challenges that come with digital transformation. It may take some time to overcome those challenges, but implementing the DevOps approach is possible and can improve efficiency in utilizing resources in every development cycle.
