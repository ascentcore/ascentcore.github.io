# How Telehealth Technology is Changing the Face of Healthcare

While telehealth technology is not new, the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to its growing popularity. Travel restrictions and social distancing have meant fewer people going out for medical appointments, especially those with pre-existing conditions that make them more susceptible to the virus.

If your business is curious about telehealth technology, and how it's affecting the healthcare industry, keep reading to learn more and how it can help your company. 
 
## What is telehealth?
 
Telehealth, also known as health IT or telemedicine, is a solution that allows the healthcare industry to integrate their medical equipment with cloud-based solutions. Put simply, telehealth systems are the collection of health information technology that involves the use of devices, screens, applications, and more to improve healthcare management. This allows doctors to reach as many patients as possible while minimizing the risk of in-person interactions.

A great example is the use of mobile healthcare applications where doctors can use their smartphones to access patient information. Patients can even use such applications to contact their doctors to ask questions, refill prescriptions, or address any other concerns they may have. 
  
## How can telehealth software improve healthcare?
 
With every other sector growing and innovating with new technology, it’s essential that the healthcare industry be able to keep up with the latest advances. Technology that makes healthcare easier, more accessible, and faster, means better service for customers and healthcare personnel. 

For instance, it can be difficult for people who live in remote areas to travel to a doctor’s office or for a doctor to reach them, but telehealth software can easily connect medical personnel with patients through video calls, online patient portals, text messages, and so much more. With healthcare available at their fingertips, people can address concerns before they become serious and keep up with any chronic issues.
  
## What are the key features of a good telehealth solution?
 
While there are many telehealth software and solutions available, there are some key features that can make a solution particularly helpful for a business. For example, online appointment scheduling allows patients and doctors to schedule appointments more efficiently.  An online dashboard where doctors and patients can easily access information can cut down on missed phone calls and unnecessary in-person appointments.  
 
Other features, such as appointment reminders, multiple payment offerings, video conferences, and even prescription and medication tracking, are all must-have telehealth software features. They can make managing healthcare needs much easier, allowing doctors to spend less time on administrative tasks and more time on their patient’s care.
 
## Conclusion
 
Telehealth software will only continue to grow and it’s essential that healthcare businesses learn to implement this technology. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, and people become more accustomed to telehealth platforms, using this technology can mean your business stays relevant and competitive.
