## The Power of Marketing Automation

This is an extremely powerful and useful tool that will help you track and respond to new prospects in your contact database. It will help you determine how to make a sales pitch to the prospect depending on where they currently are in the buying cycle. Another great way you can use marketing automation is by creating a custom lead scoring model that will track your prospect’s buyer behavior and website activity to determine if they have the right amount of interest in your product. If the system deems them to be a good match, they will be a marketing- qualified lead to forward to your sales team.

## Don’t Lose Touch with Your Prospects

When you have established a connection with certain prospects, it is important not to lose touch with them, even if a sale has already been made. Continue engaging with them and sending them more content offers and information that may be relevant to their needs. This will help you establish a true relationship with your prospects and could guarantee higher revenue and additional sales from them in the long run.

## Keep Software Sales on Track

It is crucial that you develop a sales track to follow whenever you get a prospect over the phone. An effective sales track goes like this: dial the prospect, deliver the pitch, and have your objection management strategy in place. Using this linear track will help you know how to handle the situation when you are trying to pitch a sale or engage with a prospect about a business software sale.

## Give Out Software Trials

Lastly, it is a good idea to offer software trials to prospects that are almost ready to proceed with the sale. These freebies will help entice your prospect and may be the final way for you to reel them in. Offering a sneak peek of your products and services can pay off in the long run when a prospect gets to experience your product in real time and sees how good it is.

## Conclusion

Most of the time, your prospects already have a good idea about what they are looking for so understanding buyer behavior can be more about clarifying their inquiries. Asking the right questions will lead you to what specific aspects they are looking for in software, what their challenges and pain points are, and how your product is a good fit. Utilizing these new sales techniques can help them find the best product that will suit their needs - and get you more customers.
