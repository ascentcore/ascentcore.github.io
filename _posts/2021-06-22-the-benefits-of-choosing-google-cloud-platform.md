# The Benefits of Choosing Google Cloud Platform

Google has advanced and expanded exponentially from its search engine beginnings over two decades ago. Today, with their Google Cloud Platform (GCP), the company aims to help businesses worldwide by providing reliable and highly scalable cloud computing services. Through GCP’s services, you can compute and store data and build, test, and deploy apps.

As more and more businesses turn to GCP for their cloud computing needs, you may be wondering how it could help your business. Keep reading to learn more about just a few of the benefits of choosing Google Cloud Platform.

## Better Pricing Plans

While Google Cloud Platform’s plans are not necessarily less expensive than its competitors, they do provide discounted prices for long-running workloads.

Since Google bills in minute-level increments, you only have to pay for the computer time you use, and they offer simpler pricing for customers, making it perfect for startups and IT companies who wish to cut costs. If you want to get a discount, all you need to do is keep running your workloads.

## Enhanced Execution and Higher Productivity

The performance of Google’s cloud hosting has become more enhanced than ever before. Unlike AWS and Azure, GCP gives users the option to access data remotely with various applications. Thanks to the infrastructure’s flexibility, which can support different operations, you can also decrease your web load time.

With options to use different applications, your employees have the freedom to work anywhere. As long as they use web-based apps powered by Google cloud, they can gain full access to information through any devices from wherever they are. This feature allows your company to attract and retain talent that may be looking for a flexible workplace, increase your productivity, and save on overhead costs such as office space.

## Private Fiber Network

Unlike Google’s other services, the Google Cloud Platform is largely a standalone platform that is interwoven with very few Google offerings, such as Gmail and Google Drive, but it does offer a private fiber networking infrastructure.

Since Google provides its own network, users can control the scalability of their projects. Moreover, a private fiber network can transfer data more efficiently while handling any amount of traffic. Thanks to Google’s private network, you can perform more efficiently and accurately while managing your time better.

However, it’s important to note that not all GCP customers can enjoy the benefits of a private network. GCP uses standard networks by default but you can enjoy the benefits of a private network by upgrading your services.

## Excellent Security

Google Cloud Platform has taken security to the next level, complete with security professionals who monitor and maintain the cloud platform. On top of having encrypted data, customers can also benefit from process-based and physical security investments backed by leading security experts.

GCP’s security features include:

- Encryption under 256-bit AES
- Required authentication and authorization of requests from other components
- Enhanced security of data in transit thanks to Google’s relationship with some of the world’s biggest ISPs

## Conclusion

Whether you’re a small business or a large enterprise, investing in GCP can make your business operations faster, easier, and more secure. But before you make the switch, you’ll want to partner with a software development company who can guide in making the move to ensure a smooth transition and success with the platform.
