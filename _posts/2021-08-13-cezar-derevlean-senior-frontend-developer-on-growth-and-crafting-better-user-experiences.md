# Cezar Derevlean, Senior Frontend Developer, on Growth and Crafting Better User Experiences

Cezar Derevlean is a software engineer with an insatiable thirst for knowledge. He's also the best supporter of our initiatives to improve and enhance our community; he took on the challenge to deliver exciting React training sessions to enthusiastic developers too. 

We sat down with him virtually in order to talk about his professional journey as well as to find out what key elements make him want to learn more and share it all around. 

## What is your favorite tech?

In terms of software tech it would have to do with frontend development. I’m tempted to say Javascript, but actually there’s much more than that. Let me explain.

While I was in High School learning basic programming, I started learning “to make websites” by myself (using Dreamweaver at some point, if someone feels nostalgic). I ended up learning HTML, CSS, Photoshop, a bit of Javascript and even little PHP and MySQL, while also making some not-very-little amounts of money in the process by basically doing various projects for other colleagues – I still recall having to use polyfills in certain situations in order to assure Internet Explorer 6 compatibility… – anyway, maybe that’s why nothing else that followed stuck to me as well as frontend development.
 
During Computer Science studies I had the chance to learn all sorts of technologies and concepts: algorithmics, server and client-side technologies, cryptography, computer architecture, embedded systems etc. While I got the basics for most of them and even liked a lot some of them, I still liked frontend development the most. It had to do with the fact that you’re creating something visual, tangible by the end user, you’re in charge of the user experience, you have the opportunity to make something easier and friendlier to use. When you stumble upon a terrible website and you see exactly what can be done better, it’s so great to actually be able to create something like that, but better.

Then I got hired (by the way, even though I was doing freelance for some years by myself, the progress that one can make while working in a company is astonishing, it doesn’t even compare, at least not for beginners) and as years went by I saw that while design, styling and responsiveness are great aspects to work on, I had to dig deeper in the programming side of things. That’s how I ended up learning Javascript properly and eventually adding React on top, to mention the most significant library that I’m still working with.

So, a few years and a small business adventure later, at AscentCore I find myself still loving frontend, learning new stuff but also improving on tech that I’ve been working with for years. Javascript is my favorite, but so is taking care of the User Experience, CSS and responsiveness, and last but not least, a tool that we call React to bring all these together.

## What is a typical work day for you?

Even though I love order and tidiness in my code or my environment, I can’t say that I have the greatest routine. Sometimes it’s quite chaotic. Nevertheless, I’d have to say that usually I wake up not too early, freshen up, usually skip breakfast or delay it until noon, care for the pets for a bit and then commute to the office… in the living room. Have the daily standup with the frontend developers (that’s just me) and dive in the code. If present at the actual office I’d have small breaks every now and then, make some quality coffee and have a chat or an intense debate with colleagues. If working from home, I’d enjoy those breaks with my also-working-from-home wife by a cup of coffee. Lunch is also present somewhere in that mix. In the afternoon we sync with the client and maybe have a demo if needed. If I’m at the home office I’ll mark the end of work hours by closing the laptop lid, since it’s the living room and we’re still living...

## Why did you choose to work at AscentCore?

There are a few important things that matter to me: working with technologies that I like, nice work environment and quality equipment. After more than 2 years here I was only given more reasons to stay.

What is your favorite AscentCore value and why?

That would be relationships. I really like that AscentCore takes care of its employees and they’re an actual priority for the company.

## You are holding sustained training sessions on React. What made you take up this challenge? 

I delivered training sessions before. In 2015 I started helping the less senior colleagues by giving them JavaScript/CSS information. Then I learned React myself and in 2017 when I started my own company, I had a few employees that were also my friends to whom I started to teach about everything I knew. After that, I started expanding my technical skills in JS and React even more and so last year I started delivering React training sessions at AscentCore. These learning plans are tailored to fit junior developers and backend developers who want to expand their skills to frontend or to full-stack with React. The participants were really excited, they did not miss a class, and that is why I am currently holding the third training this year. 

## What is the most important lesson you’ve learned in your role?

This is probably nothing new, so I’m just going to chant to the choir by saying that the more you know, you understand there’s so much more to know and regardless of how much you grow, you’ll still be vulnerable and prone to mistakes. It’s a process which will oftentimes point you to humbleness if you’re ready to listen, you’ll always have the chance to meet someone more skilled and you’ll always be able to grow by learning something new. Also, since I’m quite the talker, I’d say it’s quite the achievement to know your limits and learn when to shut up – this is something that I’m actively working on.
