# Andrei Rosiu, Technical Team Lead, on how to stay motivated despite challenges
Andrei Rosiu is an AscentCore rockstar who brings with him the passion for technology as well as a true heart for building successful teams. He is a breath of fresh air, and we are all so lucky to have him on our team.

We sat down with him virtually to learn about his journey and a few of his valuable insights regarding team management.

## What is your favorite tech?

Without a doubt, it’s tech that revolves around electronics and embedded hardware. After finishing my first year of Faculty, I got the chance to start an unconventional internship at a very small company in my hometown. That summer changed my perspective. I was charged with creating different circuits with different functions. Of course I failed, and I failed a lot, but I will never forget the feeling I had when I powered up my first board and saw the LED blink - an LED that I had created from scratch. That feeling gave me the motivation to learn more and create new hardware and bring meaning to it through software. That moment was a perfect point to fully understand the word ‘technology’, which comes from the greek words ‘techne’ and ‘logia,’ which beautifully translates to ‘science of craft’. This technology still amazes me as I have seen a lot of great things that were invented using this blend of hardware and software.

## What is a typical work day for you?

The early morning is the time of the day I can focus the most so I start early. I usually set a schedule for the day but I always keep in mind that I have to be open to anything that might emerge that’s a higher priority. Basically I try to stay agile and always adapt to what is more important.

Of course, there are also one or two meetings per day, but those give me the opportunity to chat with the whole team and collaborate on tasks.

## Why did you choose to work at AscentCore?

That’s easy: for the challenge. A challenge to be part of a new project and help build a reliable team - a team where trust is the common ground among its members. I feel fortunate to have been given the chance to be part of this and will do my best to rise to this challenge and grow alongside the team.

## What is your favorite AscentCore value and why?

To me, integrity is what I value most in a person and in an organization. Honest people create an environment where no matter the challenge, they are always ready to find a solution and move forward together.

People who value integrity will always do the right thing, even when the times are hard, and that leads to character. I believe that a company which surrounds itself with these kinds of people has a recipe for success in the long run.

## What is the most important lesson you’ve learned in your role?

To actively listen to the other person in a conversation. I have often made the mistake of thinking about what I was going to say next instead of actually listening to what the other person was saying. This always led to conversations without true meaning or collaboration. After I started to really listen then each conversation started to be more meaningful.
