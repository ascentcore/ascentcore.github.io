# AWS vs. Azure vs. Google Cloud: Which Cloud Platform to Choose?

When it comes to cloud solutions, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon are the frontrunners. This is because they provide the most secure, versatile, and reliable cloud services to clients and businesses worldwide. They also offer a wide range of storage, computing, and networking services, among many others. This is where the big three cloud platforms come into the picture — Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft Azure, and Amazon Web Services (AWS).

In this article, we will go deeper into the topic and explore the differences between GCP, Azure, and AWS. Are you interested in discovering which of the solutions sits your business best? Keep on reading to uncover our unbiased review.

## 1. Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

GCP is a suite of cloud computing services running on the same Google infrastructure used for its end-user products. These include the Google search engine, YouTube, and many others. With its rise back in 2011, GCP has quickly taken grounds in the cloud industry. What started as strengthening Google products has metamorphosed into offering cloud computing services to clients and businesses worldwide.

What’s good about GCP is that it serves as an excellent alternative to the other two cloud platforms. It is notable for its affordable cost, intuitive interface, and flexible compute options. On top of that, it is best known for its payment configuration, privacy and traffic security, cost-efficiency, and Machine Learning (ML).

## 2. Microsoft Azure

Microsoft Azure came to the scene to develop, deploy, and manage different applications and various services for clients and businesses. It achieves these via the network of Microsoft-managed datacenters. This cloud platform was launched back in 2010. It was designed to provide computing services to various companies. 

When it comes to cloud services, Azure offers computing, networking, data management databases, and performance. It is also known for providing higher security, greater reliability, and lower latency than the rest. Since its development, Microsoft Azure has shown growth and development amidst the two competitors.

## 3. Amazon Web Services (AWS)

AWS is a subsidiary of [amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/). It offers an on-demand cloud computing platform to individuals, companies, and governments on a paid-subscription basis. As a pioneer of cloud computing, it has paved the way for the cloud computing market for over a decade.

AWS has a wide range of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).  It offers numerous solutions such as computing, database, content delivery and storage, and networking. Considered as the benchmark of cloud service quality, it is currently the leader among cloud platforms in terms of the products offered and customers who patronize it.

## What cloud platform to choose
