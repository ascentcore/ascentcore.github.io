# Tell-Tale Signs You Need a New Software Development Partner

Software development has become one of the most important aspects of modern business, allowing you to exponentially expand your business’ reach. Since [one-in-five American adults only use smartphones to access the internet](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/internet-broadband/), an app allows you to tap into a vast number of potential customers without engaging in costly and time consuming promotional campaigns. In fact, having a quality and easy-to-use app can give your business an edge over the competition, which is why you’ll want to look for a software development company to partner with. 

However, not all software development companies are created equal and you could end up working with a company that isn’t a good fit. If you find yourself in this situation, it may be best to move on and find a new company to partner with. But keep in mind that you’ll want to spot any red flags early in the process so it’s easier to pivot and address any challenges. So how can you spot the warning signs that your software development partnership isn’t working out? Keep reading for our tell-tale signs that you need to start looking for someone new.

## Budget Overruns

One clear-cut sign of inefficiency is the project going over the agreed-upon budget. While your app is a worthwhile investment and you want to make sure you’ve assessed the budget needed for the development, rollout, and marketing of the app, you don’t want to exceed your allocations. If a software developer is frequently coming back to you with revised numbers and going over budget, that could be an indicator of inexperience or a lack of planning - neither of which bodes well for a successful partnership. 

## Constant Delays

While some delays in software development projects are inevitable, it’s not a good sign when the company you’re working with is constantly missing deadlines. This will not only cost you more money but can also lead to rushed implementation as everyone is playing catch up on deadlines and deliverables. The part of software development that usually takes the hit here is quality assurance (QA). Cutting corners with QA just to push the app out the door as quickly as possible can lead to bugs and improper functionality. And nothing will make a user leave an app faster than things not working properly.

## Lack of Tangible Results

The final tell-tale sign that you should replace your software development partner is a lack of tangible results. But this doesn’t necessarily mean that the outcome is a bad app. An app may have a good design and be technically sound and still be considered unsuccessful if it doesn’t help you meet your business goals. At Ascent Core, we have extensive experience partnering with businesses to understand their goals and creating a product that helps get them there. 

## Conclusion

It’s important to remember that knowing when to move on from a software development company can be just as important as choosing the right one that fits your needs. Be sure to keep a watchful eye on the process to ensure you have a true partner in creating a successful app that meets your business needs.
