#  How Industry Giants Develop Innovative Audio Experiences

This summer, US satellite-radio provider SiriusXM together with Pandora and the Chinese social networking platform TikTok, launched a new channel called TikTok Radio. This is part of their strategic partnership to increase exposure and adoption among the Gen Z audience - an influential group of content consumers. The first of its kind, this creator-hosted radio station is a full-time music channel featuring the trending sounds that are redefining pop culture from TikTok, while Pandora listeners will get access to playlists curated by TikTok's top creators.  

## How it works

The channel is sonically synched to the TikTok experience and features a diverse group of creators showcasing trending music and stories behind the songs throughout each day, as well as a weekly music countdown dedicated to TikTok's trending tracks. 

Pandora also launched a series of exclusive playlists featuring popular TikTok creators who take listeners through their favorite songs with special commentary about their selections. The creators will curate, host, and promote the playlists to their fans on TikTok. 

## Innovative opportunities

This experience will redefine the way fans discover music and artists while also enabling a new form of musical engagement and creative expression. Listeners will have the unique opportunity to connect with their favorite creators with content experiences that have never been done before in audio. And they’ll be able to do it from a variety of devices at any time of the day or night.

This is also an opportunity for TikTok to continue to break new ground in the social media landscape. The platform has already redefined how creators create and audiences engage, and this new channel will only add to this innovation. Creators will benefit from broader exposure for themselves and their content, while producers might even create tracks and re-name songs based on what's gaining the most traction in the app. 

The partnership between TikTok and SiriusXM will help to solidify the connection between music fans and the app. Brands that are looking to improve their presence in the app, the radio show will be providing some more perspective on key trends of note and that could help them to guide their understanding and strategy.

## Conclusion

The demand for audio and video content will only increase in coming years as audiences come to expect on-demand content creation. The prevalence of smart devices delivering that content also continues to accelerate so businesses should pay attention and find innovative ways to stay competitive. TikTok radio is just one example of the kind of new and exciting developments we can all expect in the future.
